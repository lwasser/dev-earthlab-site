This site hosts resources developed by the Earth Lab team at University of Colorado, Boulder. 
This website contains data, code tutorials, and blog posts related to our work. 
Most of the tutorials are aimed at building R and Python skills relevant to working with Earth analytics, including geospatial, social, biological, and earth systems data. 
The Analytics Hub is part of Earth Lab at the University of Colorado Boulder. 

## Our Team

Our mission is to both capitalize on the data deluge from Space and other platforms to accelerate science and to train a new generation of data scientists who can apply their knowledge to addressing outstanding Earth Science questions. 
Our team approaches Earth analytics from a diverse set of perspectives, with backgrounds in high performance computing, statistics, visualization, and applied science.
